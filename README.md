- 👋 Hi, I’m @Skamet
- 👀 I’m interested in Programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#.net in a 240h course. Already have 42h behind me as of the 11th of July.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Projects I plan to write in the near future, mostly for automating processes we use in the Automotive Industry -> SAP/IMDS/Excel
- 📫 How to reach me ...? From here I guess. I'm still a newbie but a determent one. Hopefully beginning 2022 I will be experienced enough to become a full-time developer instead of my current position as a Sales Supervisor.
